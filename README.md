# NLP Applications (I): Understanding NLP

Welcome to the "NLP Applications (I): Understanding NLP" repository! This repository contains my solutions to the assignments and practical tasks from the course on Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Course Description

The objective of this course is to introduce the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by exploring its most widely used applications in both academic and industrial settings. The course covers basic NLP techniques, including document classification, sequence labeling for opinion mining, vector-based word representations (embeddings), and text normalization and preprocessing. Additionally, it emphasizes the role of machine translation in professional contexts, focusing on the post-edition process. The course adopts a practical approach, incorporating labs and hands-on tasks to equip students with NLP tools based on machine and deep learning.

## Syllabus

The course covers the following topics:

1. **Introduction to NLP: Practical Applications (Opinion Mining and Machine Translation)**: An overview of NLP and its real-world applications, including sentiment analysis and machine translation.

2. **Multilingual Document Classification**: Exploration of document classification tasks with a focus on sentiment analysis and detecting fake news in news articles and social networks.

3. **Sequence Labeling for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**: Understanding the process of sequence labeling for analyzing the sentiment associated with specific aspects in text.

4. **Post-Editing and Evaluation in Machine Translation**: Delving into the essential post-editing process and evaluating machine translation outputs.

## Assignments

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the assignments and practical tasks given during the course. Each assignment is organized into separate directories, and the solutions are provided in the form of code, notebooks, or reports, as applicable.

## Note

These solutions are provided as reference material and examples for fellow students. If you are currently enrolled in the same course, I encourage you to attempt the assignments independently before referring to these solutions.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions can aid your understanding of NLP concepts and implementations, please refrain from submitting them as your own work for grading purposes. Academic integrity is of utmost importance.
